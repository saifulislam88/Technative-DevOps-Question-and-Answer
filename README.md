#### ðŸš€ Process-Thread-Daemon-Service

##### ðŸ“Œ [Process]()

- A process is an instance of a running program. It is the basic unit of execution in Linux.
- Each process has its own memory space, and it can perform tasks independently.
- A process can creates other processes which are known as Child Processes.

**Example:** Running firefox creates a process for the Firefox web browser. When you run **`ls -la`**, it creates a temporary process that executes the command and produces output. 

**Relation to threads & daemon:**\
`A process can create multiple threads to perform tasks concurrently. A daemon is a type of process that runs in the background.`

##### ðŸ“Œ [Thread]()

- A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled by the operating system.
- Threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process but run independently.
- A thread have 3 states: running, ready, and blocked

**Example:** In a web server like Apache, each request might be handled by a separate thread within the same process.

**Relation to process:**
Threads exist within a process and share its resources. Multiple threads can run simultaneously within the same process.
