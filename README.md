##### ðŸ“Œ Process

**1.** A process is an instance of a running program. It is the basic unit of execution in Linux.\
**2.** Each process has its own memory space, and it can perform tasks independently.

**Example:** Running firefox creates a process for the Firefox web browser.

**Relation to Others:**\
`A process can create multiple threads to perform tasks concurrently. A daemon is a type of process that runs in the background.`
