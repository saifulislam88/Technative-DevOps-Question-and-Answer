## [Process-Thread-Daemon-Service]()

Here's a concise explanation of `processes`, `threads`, `daemons`, and `services` in Linux, along with examples and their relationships:

### üìå[Process]()

- A process is an instance of a running program. It is the basic unit of execution in Linux.\
- Each process has its own memory space, and it can perform tasks independently.\
- A process can creates other processes which are known as Child Processes.

üîÑ**Example:** Running firefox creates a process for the Firefox web browser. When you run **`ls -la`**, it creates a temporary process that executes the command and produces output. 

‚è∞**Relation to threads & daemon:**\
**`A process can create multiple threads to perform tasks concurrently. A daemon is a type of process that runs in the background.`**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå[Thread]()                                                                                                     

- A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled by the operating system.\
- Threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process but run independently.\
- A thread have 3 states: running, ready, and blocked

üîÑ**Example:** In a web server like Apache, each request might be handled by a separate thread within the same process.

‚è∞**Relation to process:**\
**`Threads exist within a process and share its resources. Multiple threads can run simultaneously within the same process.`**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå[Daemon]()

- A daemon is a background process that runs continuously and is usually started at boot time.
- Daemons typically provide system or network services.

üîÑ**Example:** **`cron`** is a daemon that executes scheduled tasks & **`httpd`** handles incoming HTTP requests and serves web pages.

‚è∞**Relation to process:**\
**`A daemon is a type of process, but it runs in the background and is detached from any terminal session.`**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå[Service]()

- A service is a specific function or set of functions provided by the operating system, usually managed by a daemon.
- Services are typically started at boot and managed by service managers like systemd.

üîÑ**Example:** `nginx` as a web server service that is managed by the `nginx` daemon.

‚è∞**Relation to daemon:**\
**`A service is provided by a daemon process. Services can involve multiple processes and threads to perform their tasks.`**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìå[Relationships]()

- A process is an independent program, while threads are the sub-units of a process, sharing its resources.
- All daemons are processes, but not all processes are daemons. Daemons run in the background and provide services.
- A service is typically provided by a daemon. The daemon manages the process(es) that provide the service.




## Hardware Sizing Planning for Application

### Definitions:

- **Operating System**: The software that manages hardware resources and provides services for application software.

- **Application**: The software application being deployed or planned, which performs specific tasks or functions.

- **Total Active User**: The total number of users actively interacting with the application at any given time.

- **TPS (Transactions Per Second)**: The number of transactions processed by the application per second.

- **Concurrent Login**: The number of users logged into the application simultaneously.

- **Concurrent User**: A user who is active in a collaborative editing session. Idle users connected to the document do not significantly impact the server load.

- **Concurrent Session**: The number of active sessions at the same time. For collaborative applications, it indicates how many users are actively engaged in the application simultaneously.

### Example Scenario:

- **Concurrent Sessions Requirement**: 500

- **Current Capacity Handling**: In a NodeJS setup, 514 concurrent sessions are handled by a server with 4 Core CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.

- **Resource Requirement**: Based on the above scenario, the application needs 2 NL/MW (Network Layer/Middleware) servers, each with at least 4 Core CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.

- **High Availability**: To ensure high availability and avoid a single point of failure, deploy two of each critical component:
  - Load Balancer (LB)
  - Web Server
  - NL/MW (Network Layer/Middleware)
  - BL/MW (Business Logic/Middleware)

### Recommendations for Hardware Sizing:

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the hardware configuration allows for scaling up (increasing resources on existing machines) and scaling out (adding more machines) to accommodate growth.

- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to track server performance and application load. This helps in making informed decisions about resource adjustments.

- **Testing**: Conduct load testing and performance benchmarking to validate the hardware sizing and identify potential bottlenecks before going into production.

- **Redundancy**: Include redundancy in the design for critical components to improve reliability and uptime.

- **Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize server configurations based on usage patterns and performance data.
