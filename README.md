#### [Process-Thread-Daemon-Service]()

#### 📌[Process]()

- A process is an instance of a running program. It is the basic unit of execution in Linux.
- Each process has its own memory space, and it can perform tasks independently.
- A process can creates other processes which are known as Child Processes.

**Example:** Running firefox creates a process for the Firefox web browser. When you run **`ls -la`**, it creates a temporary process that executes the command and produces output. 

**Relation to threads & daemon:**\
`A process can create multiple threads to perform tasks concurrently. A daemon is a type of process that runs in the background.`

#### 📌[`Thread]()                                                                                                            `

- A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled by the operating system.
- Threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process but run independently.
- A thread have 3 states: running, ready, and blocked

**Example:** In a web server like Apache, each request might be handled by a separate thread within the same process.

**Relation to process:**\
**`Threads exist within a process and share its resources. Multiple threads can run simultaneously within the same process.`**

#### 📌[Daemon]()

- A daemon is a background process that runs continuously and is usually started at boot time.
- Daemons typically provide system or network services.

**Example:** **`cron`** is a daemon that executes scheduled tasks & **`httpd`** handles incoming HTTP requests and serves web pages.

**Relation to process:**\
**`A daemon is a type of process, but it runs in the background and is detached from any terminal session.`**

#### 📌[Service]()

- A service is a specific function or set of functions provided by the operating system, usually managed by a daemon.
- Services are typically started at boot and managed by service managers like systemd.

**Example:** `nginx` as a web server service that is managed by the `nginx` daemon.

**Relation to daemon:**\
**`A service is provided by a daemon process. Services can involve multiple processes and threads to perform their tasks.`**


#### 📌[Relationships]()

- A process is an independent program, while threads are the sub-units of a process, sharing its resources.
- All daemons are processes, but not all processes are daemons. Daemons run in the background and provide services.
- A service is typically provided by a daemon. The daemon manages the process(es) that provide the service.
